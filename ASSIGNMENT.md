# DSCI 554 Assignment 1

The assignment is modeled after the example on UN Data in Part I, Ch.1 of Cairo, Alberto, The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization, by Alberto Cairo. instead of truthful art in which Cairo plots UN data. In this assignment, we will learn to design and build a visual display with charts in JavaScript to _inform_ the user about one or several UN datasets. Before you submit your work, inspect `index.html` in Chrome to make sure that:

1. There are no errors
2. The page and charts are well formatted according to the rubric
3. The information needed to understand the dataset is included and well-presented according to the rubric

## Description

Select [UN data](http://data.un.org) of your choice (one or more datasets) and create a visual display in HTML (a simple HTML page named `index.html` is sufficient) to _inform_ the viewer about the dataset(s). You must include at least one plot realized with d3 and one created using the Google Charts library. In the `README.md`, you must explain your design choices for the display, the charts (form and encodings), and the information presented.

## Rubric

|               | Design            | Visual display implementation      |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Sophisticated | Design choices are presented in the README.md with proper Markdown formatting. The choices are well thought out and explained for the display (e.g., layout), the charts (e.g., choice of form and visual encodings, axes, etc.) and the information presented (e.g., explanatory text to facilitate the comprehension of the datasets presented) (4-5 pts) | The visual display presents the information clearly, the page is well-formatted, the page has no errors, at least one D3 chart, and one Google Chart plots are included (4-5 pts) |
| Competent     | Design choices are poorly presented in the README.md, and/or Markdown formatting is incorrect. The choices are not well thought out and/or insufficiently explained for the display (e.g., layout), the charts (e.g., choice of form and visual encodings, axes, etc.), and the information presented (e.g., explanatory text to facilitate the comprehension of the datasets presented) (2-3 pts) | The visual display does not present the information clearly enough, the page is not well formatted, and or the page contains errors, only one D3 chart or Google Chart plot is included (2-3 pts) |
| Needs work    | Design choices are not presented in the README.md and or not using proper Markdown formatting. The choices are not well thought out and/or explained for the display (e.g., layout), the charts (e.g., choice of form and visual encodings, axes, etc.), and the information presented (e.g., explanatory text to facilitate the comprehension of the datasets presented) (0-1 pts) | The visual display does not present the information clearly, the page is not well formatted, the page has errors, D3 chart and/or Google Chart plots are not included (0-1 pts) |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
